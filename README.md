# Fandom_Wiki_Fix
We can't change the fact that Fandom destroyed all that was holy with Gamepedia wikis, but we can try. I wrote this Tampermonkey script to try to at least make the wikis Usable again.

# How to use

1. Download [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/), a simple extension that lets you put scripts to be executed when you visit a specific page, to modify the web page.

2. Paste either the [source code](/source.js) or the [compressed code](/compressed.js), both do the same thing, it's just a lot of cool kids use the harder to read compressed one.

... and you're done!

# Notes

Don't use this if you like to edit wikis, but if you like editing wikis your goose was probably cooked anyway when Fandom screwed us over by forcing a redesign on Gamepedia wikis nobody wanted. This mod will make it even more impossible to edit wikis since it will remove a lot of the user settings and Fandom general buttons that are never useful for people just using a wiki for looking things up.
