# Fandom_Wiki_Fix
We can't change the fact that Fandom destroyed all that was holy with Gamepedia wikis, but we can try. I wrote this Tampermonkey script to try to at least make the wikis usable again.

# How to use

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), a simple extension that lets you put scripts to be executed when you visit a specific page, to modify the web page.

2. Simply click [here](https://github.com/Gamepro5/Fandom_Wiki_Fix/raw/main/compressed.user.js) and Tampermonkey will prompt you to install it.

... and you're done!

# Notes

Don't use this if you like to edit wikis, but if you like editing wikis your goose was probably cooked anyway when Fandom screwed us over by forcing a redesign on Gamepedia wikis nobody wanted. This mod will make it even more impossible to edit wikis since it will remove a lot of the user settings and Fandom general buttons that are never useful for people just using a wiki for looking things up.

This does not remove ads. If you wish to remove ads just use UblockOrigin.
